            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Stone Canyon church of Christ has only one goal: to glorify God. We do this in various ways. We worship Him only in the way He has asked us to while putting on a heart of sincerity. We share the teachings of Jesus with others. We live in the way that matches those teachings. And we encourage and lift up fellow Christians daily. We admit we are not perfect, but we do our best and pray God will forgive our failures (and has told us He will).</p>

            <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
            <p>
                At Stone Canyon, we believe God is the creator of the universe. He made man in His image so we would be like Him. 
                But man sinned and broke his pure relationship with God. When we sin even today, we break our relationship with Him. So, 
                in order for God to join us back to Him, sin must be removed. 
            </p>
            <p>

                To do that, God the Father sent His Son Jesus to die for us. His gracious sacrifice will save us if we are willing to die with 
                Jesus by turning from our sinful life, confessing our faith in Him, and being immersed in water. 
                As people saved by God, we are added to His one church so that we can worship Him, grow in our knowledge of Him, and 
                teach His word to others. 

            </p>
            <p>
                We believe this because it is what His word teaches. The Holy Spirit revealed God's mind to us so we could follow Him. We 
                do not believe any teachings about God if it's not found in the Bible. 
                So...don't believe this just because we said it, but let's look at God's word together! That's where the answers are.
